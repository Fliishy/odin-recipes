        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The chicken is deep fried twice to make the exterior extra crispy and to lock moisture 
            in. The gochujang sauce is a hot, honey, spicy mix...and well, it's just fabulous. 
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 pound chicken breast tenderloins</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup potato starch</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk milk and egg together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined and smooth. 
                Add chicken tenders to egg wash and let marinate in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Combine flour, potato starch, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Pour mixture 
                into a large, resealable plastic bag. Drain and discard marinade from chicken tenders.
                 Add chicken to the bag, seal it, and shake until each piece is completely dredged in 
                 mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Add chicken pieces to the hot oil about 5 pieces at a time so as not to drop the 
                temperature of the oil. Fry for 2 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate lined with 
                paper towels to drain. Continue with remaining chicken pieces.
            </li>
            <li>Increase oil heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until continuously boiling. 
                Carefully add the first batch of cooked chicken and fry again until cooked through 
                and crispy about 2 minutes more. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. 
                Repeat with the second batch of chicken pieces. Transfer chicken to a medium-sized 
                serving bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add honey, brown sugar, soy sauce, 
                gochujang paste, Worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, and ginger. Cook and 
                stir continuously until sugar has melted and sauce is smooth, about 5 minutes. 
                Drizzle sauce over twice-fried chicken tenders and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
